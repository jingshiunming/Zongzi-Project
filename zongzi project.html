      <h1>Zongzi Á≤ΩÂ≠ê</h1>
      <h2>
        (Chinese: Á≤ΩÂ≠ê) is a traditional Chinese rice dish made of glutinous
        rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves, they
        are cooked by steaming or boiling. In the Western world, they are also
        known as rice dumplings or sticky rice dumplings.

      <p>
        Zongzi are traditionally eaten during the Duanwu Festival (Á´ØÂçàËäÇ) which
        falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar,
        and commonly known as the "Dragon Boat Festival" in English. The
        festival falls each year on a day in late-May to mid-June in the Western
        calendar.
        <br />
        <br />
        Chinese people eat Zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival to memorialize
        Qu Yuan, an advisor in the court of Chu during the Warring States period
        of ancient China who was exiled by the emperor for perceived disloyalty.
        Qu Yuan had proposed a strategic alliance with the state of Qi in order
        to fend off the threatening state of Qin, but the emperor didn‚Äôt buy it
        and sent Qu Yuan off to the wilderness. Unfortunately, Qu Yuan was right
        about the threat presented by the Qin, which soon captured and
        imprisoned the Chu emperor. The next Chu king surrendered the state to
        their rivals. Upon hearing the tragic news, Qu Yuan drowned himself in
        the Miluo River in Hunan Province.
        <br />
        <br />
        In memory of him, every year on the 5th day of the 5th lunar month, the
        day he drowned himself, dragon boat races, which are said to represent
        the search for his body, are held, and the Chinese people eat zongzi,
        which was originally thrown into the river to keep the fishes from
        eating the body of Qu Yuan. An interesting legend of Zongzi has been
        passed down through generations from ancient China.
